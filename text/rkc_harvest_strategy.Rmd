#Background
Red king crab (*Paralithodes camtschaticus*) are taken primarily in the protected bays, inlets, and adjacent shorelines in Southeast Alaska north of Petersburg; few red king crab are caught from the southern portion of Southeast. Red king crab generally inhabit depths less than 200 fathoms. Historically, important red king crab fishing grounds have included Gambier Bay, Pybus Bay, Seymour Canal, the Juneau area, Lynn Canal, Holkham Bay, Excursion Inlet, and Peril Strait. Blue king crab (*P. platypus*) may be taken only during the open fisheries for red and golden king crab (*Lithodes aequispinus*) and Tanner crab (*Chionoecetes bairdi*). Small quantities of blue king crab are harvested incidentally during those fisheries (Messmer et al. 2021).

Management of the commercial red king crab fishery is based on the Southeast Alaska Red King Crab Management Plan (5 AAC 34.113). This management plan was designed to be consistent with the board’s policy on “King and Tanner Crab Resource Management”. It establishes a November– January season that avoids sensitive life history stages of reproduction including mating and molting, restricts harvest to males only with a minimum legal-size limit of 7 inches carapace width, and establishes gear restrictions and annual guideline harvest levels (GHLs) based on appropriate harvest rates and annual stock assessment surveys. Harvest of red and blue king crab, regardless of their sex or size, infected with parasitic barnacle species Briarosaccus regalis is allowed because these parasites hinder reproduction and suppress growth of king crab (Noever et al. 2016).  

Within Section 11-A, management of the red and blue king crab personal use fishery is based on the Section 11-A Red and Blue King Crab Management and Allocation Plan (5 AAC 34.111), which allocates harvest between the commercial and personal use fishery at 40% and 60% respectively. The plan also allocates the GHL between winter and summer seasons at 10% and 50% respectively to provide greater opportunity for the public. The personal use fishery requires harvest permits for Section 11-A and for the remainder of the region to document harvest and effort to help manage the fishery. The regionwide permit began in 2018 and is required for all king crab species (red, blue, and golden), whereas Section 11-A is required only for red and blue king crab (Messmer et al. 2021). 


#Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide the basis for a recommended update to the Southeast Red and Blue King Crab harvest strategy 5 ACC 34.080 and 5 ACC 77.664 and to lay the framework for a consistent and transparent approach for management decisions. We provide a brief history of the biology and stock assessment, fishery management goals and objectives, and recommended harvest strategy. 

#Biology and Stock Assessment
Life history of red king crab is better understood than other Lithodid species but remains incomplete (Donaldson 2005). Adult females brood thousands of embryos. When the embryos are fully developed, they hatch as zoea (swimming larvae), but are susceptible to the movements of tides and currents. After feeding on plant and animal plankton for several months and undergoing several body changes with each molt, the larvae settle to the ocean bottom and molt into megalopa (nonswimming larvae). Juveniles molt many times in their first few years, then less frequently until they reach sexual maturity (ADF&G 2021). Adult and older juveniles occur on a variety of substrates including rock and gravel, mud, sand, shell hash, and mixtures of these types. Red king crab are sexually mature at 5 to 6 years of age (O’Clair 1998). Adult females must molt in order to mate but males do not. Adult males often skip a molt and keep the same shell for one or two years. Adult red king crab exhibit near shore to offshore (or shallow to deep) and back, annual migrations. They come to shallow water in late winter and by spring the female's embryos hatch. Adult females and some adult males molt and mate before they start their offshore feeding migration to deeper waters. Adult crabs tend to segregate by sex off the mating-molting grounds. Adult male red king crab have been known to migrate long distances, moving at times as fast as a mile per day (ADF&G 2021).
Management of red king crab fisheries in Southeast Alaska is abundance-based and requires annual surveys to assess stock size (Stratman et al. 2019). Stock assessment utilizes several types of data: commercial harvest, personal use harvest, catch per unit effort (CPUE), and length/weight relationships from surveys. These data, along with estimates of growth and natural mortality, are used as input into a 3-stage catch-survey model (CSA model) to determine regional biomass estimates of mature and legal red king crab, that along with exploitation rates, are used to determine harvestable surplus levels for the commercial and personal use fisheries (Palof and Stratman 2021).

Outside Section 11-A, red and blue king crab personal use fisheries are managed by size, sex, season, and a bag limit; there are no allocations specified in regulation and no GHLs are established. However, stock assessment information is used to guide decisions on closing areas to personal use fishing and to establish personal use bag and possession limits.
The department has conducted surveys of red king crab abundance in Southeast Alaska since 1979. The surveys provides indices of crab abundance by sex and recruit class in terms of crab per pot. The surveys occur in areas of high red king crab harvest. Significant improvements, resulting in successive decreases in the coefficient of variation (CV; a measure of variability) of CPUE data, have been achieved over the 30-year survey time series. These include a change from fixed to random pot locations and stratification of survey areas in 1986; a gradual shift from square to cone pots over the period 1995–1999 (Zhou and Shirley 1997d); re-stratification of the survey to redefine strata boundaries based upon the CPUE of legal, sublegal, and female red king crab in 2005 (Clark 2008); and most recently, an increase in the number of pots set in each surveyed area to improve the precision of survey area estimates. A detailed timeline and methods of survey development is outlined in Clark (2008) and Clark et al. (2003).

Due to industry concerns about the red king crab stock assessment program, the department initiated an external review in 2005 (Quinn et al. 2006) and several suggestions for improvements were made, including delaying the start date of the survey to avoid non-feeding molting crab, re-stratifying the survey design for more precise pot placement (Clark 2008), comparing mark-recapture abundance estimates to the CSA (Palof and Stratman 2021), implementing a tagging study to help determine molt increments and movements, deploying temperature loggers on each pot, and assessing clutch fullness each year in each bay (Stratman et al. 2019). Even with these improvements, because of continued industry concerns, the department and industry cooperatively operated a project from 2010–2018 to independently estimate red king crab abundances using mark–recapture methods.

#Harvest Strategy Goals
The primary goal  of the proposed Southeast red king crab harvest strategy is to transition from a fishery opening decision based on an economic threshold [5 AAC 34.113 (c)] to a biological threshold using historical mature male abundance estimates from survey data (1979–2019), which will rely on setting biological reference points. Secondary goals are to recommend a regionwide harvest strategy that improves and stabilizes fishery performance using transparent and repeatable metrics from long term baseline survey data; maintain historical size and age compositions to maintain long-term reproductive viability; minimize handling and unnecessary mortality of non-legal red king crab and non-target species; and reduce dependency on annual recruitment. 
Harvest strategies have been implemented for king crab fisheries in other areas of Alaska to improve fisheries management and sustainability. These harvest strategies are comprised of biological, fishery dependent and independent reference points (i.e., mature male biomass, CPUE, annual recruitment, etc.) that are used in recommending the total allowable catch (TAC) or GHL for a given management area and season (Daly et al. 2019; Daly and Jackson 2020; Siddeek et al. 2020).

#Harvest Strategy Scenarios
We developed and compared two harvest policy scenarios that were derived from the *Saint Matthew Island Section blue king crab harvest strategy* [5 AAC 34.917] and *Aleutian Islands golden king crab* [5 AAC 34.612] (Daly et al. 2019) and adapted to reflect the spatial stock structure of red and blue king crab in Southeast Alaska. Each harvest policy scenario has three elements: 1. a threshold for opening or closing the directed fishery and establishing bag and possession limits for the regionwide personal use fishery, 2. an exploitation rate on mature and legal male abundance, and 3. a maximum exploitation rate on legal male abundance. For all scenarios, the directed fishery is prohibited, and bag and possession limits reduced in the regionwide personal use fishery if $\frac{MMA}{MMA_{AVE}}$ or if $\frac{LMA}{LMA_{AVE}} <50\%$, dependent on the scenario. Exploitation rates increase linearly based on the ratio of the current year $MMA$ or $LMA$ relative to their respective long-term averages for the period of 1979–2019 (Figure 1). The 1979–2019 period was chosen because it uses all of the survey data and incorporates more contrasting high and low years of abundance than the current long-term baseline used in the stock assessment (1993–2007). The exploitation rate is subsequently capped when $\frac{MMA}{MMA_{AVE}} ≥ 1$. The maximum exploitation rate on legal males utilizing an MMA harvest strategy provides additional protection against over harvesting legal males in years when mature male abundance is high relative to the entire size range of mature male abundance.  Both scenarios were retrospectively applied to MMA and LMA estimates and examined for trade-offs compared to historical management decisions from 2000–2021. 

##Scenario A
The commercial fishery may open under the following conditions **1.** and **2.** and preseason survey estimate of $MMA$ under the following conditions and illustrated in Figure 2: 

  **1.** when $MMA$ is greater than 50% but less than the 100% of $MMA_{1979–2019}$, the number of legal males available for harvest or total allowable catch (TAC) will be no more than Eq. 1 or 25% of the preseason survey estimate of legal abundance, whichever is less.

\begin{equation}
TAC_{max}= 0.1 \times {(\frac{MMA}{MMA_{1979-2019}})\times MMA_{regionwide}}
\tag{1}
\end{equation}

  **2.** when $MMA$ is equal to or greater than $MMA_{1979-2019}$ the number of legal males available for harvest or TAC available for harvest will be no more than 10 percent of the preseason survey estimate of $MMA$ or 25% of the preseason survey estimate of legal abundance, whichever is less. 
  
##Scenario B
The commercial fishery may open under the following conditions **1.** and **2.** and preseason survey estimate of $LMA$ under the following conditions and illustrated in Figure 2: 

  **1.**when $LMA$ is greater than 50% but less than 100% of $LMA_{1979–2019}$, the number of legal males available for harvest or total allowable catch (TAC) will be no more than Eq. 2.
  
\begin{equation}
TAC_{max}= 0.1 \times {(\frac{LMA}{LMA_{1979-2019}})\times LMA_{regionwide}}
\tag{2}
\end{equation}

  **2.** when $LMA$ is equal to or greater than $LMA_{1979-2019}$ the number of legal males available for harvest or TAC available for harvest will be no more than 10 percent of the preseason survey estimate of $LMA$.

#Results
Both harvest scenarios (A and B) were applied retrospectively from 2000–2021 and compared to historical harvest rates and TACs (Table 1).  The results of this analysis showed that both scenarios had a higher maximum harvest rate and associated TAC from 2000–2003 compared to historical management decisions. From 2004–2021 both scenarios had lower maximum harvest rates and TACs, however, they showed potential for increased fishing opportunity where opportunity increased by 1 for scenario A and increased by 4 for scenario B compared to historical management decisions. It is important to note that the maximum harvest rate of $LMA$ as described in scenario A was never employed suggesting that this harvest rate on $LMA$ needs to be adjusted to reflect Southeast stocks. 

#Management Considerations and Future Recommendations
The recommended harvest strategies scenarios (A and B) reflect options to update the current harvest strategy from an economic threshold to a biological one and sets a maximum harvest rate based on the level of $MMA$ or $LMA$. The current and historical management process has resulted in inconsistently determined harvest rates used to calculate TAC and trigger a fishery opening, and it has provided for less fishing opportunity in the commercial and personal use fisheries. The scenario A harvest strategy is the most widely applied harvest strategy for Alaska crab stocks in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands that utilizes $MMA$ to set harvest rates with a protection buffer to not overharvest legal males if $MMA$ is high relative to the entire size range of $MMA$. The maximum harvest rate on legal males needs to be adapted to reflect Southeast stocks such as, through a long-term percent difference between $MMA$ and $LMA$, a revised constant static number, or the cumulative sum of the percent differences for surveyed areas. 

Overall, both scenarios set a maximum TAC at the regionwide level and management would maintain flexibility in setting TACs at each area respectively. Stock health scores from survey data will be used to define and set TACs for fishery areas. Management of the fishery in recent years (2011 and 2017) has resulted in areas being open approximately 24 hours which increases difficulty for managing to a respective TAC. Scenarios A and B propose lower maximum TACs that are significantly less than the most recent fisheries and implementing new harvest control rules (HCRs) to make this achievable will be considered. Industry has requested and proposed increased opportunity at lower TAC levels utilizing HCRs that include one or combination of equal quota share and trip-limits. In order to not exceed fishery area TACs, every effort will be made to actively manage these areas inseason. 

This harvest strategy may be amended in future iterations as we gain additional information and user input. This harvest strategy is a first step to increase transparency regarding management metrics utilized for inseason and postseason decisions. 


#Current Harvest Strategy

The current harvest strategy utilizes an economic threshold....

PU management plan stipulates red and blue whereas commercial stipulates red king crab only

##Commercial Fishery

**5 AAC 34.113. Southeast Alaska Red King Crab Management Plan**

* (a) The Southeast Alaska red king crab fishery shall be managed consistently with the board's "Policy on King and Tanner Crab Resource Management" (90-04-FB, March 23, 1990), adopted by this reference and accoridng to the principles set out in this section.

* (b) The department shall close an area if the abundance of various sizes of male and female crabs is inadequate to provide for a sustained harvest, or when potentially high effort precludes an orderly fishery.

* (c) The department shall close the fishery if the department's estimate of the available harvest is below the minimum threshold of 200,000 pounds of legal male red king crab.

* (d) The department shall determine an approrpiate harvest rate before the opening of the fishery. The harvest rate is the percentage of the legal males that can be harvested while providing for the long-term reproductive viability of red king crab stocks. The department shlal base the harvest rate on estimates of abundance of the various size classes of male and female crabs, and on factors affecting the reproductive viability of the stock.

* (e) The depatment shall determine the guideline harvest level before each fishing season. The guideline harvest level is the sum of the estimates of sustainable harvest for each fishing district. If stock assessment data are not available, the guideline harvest level will be based on historical fishery performance, catch, and population information. A lack of adequate information will result in conservative management.


##Personal Use Fishery

**5 AAC 77.664. Personal use king crab fishery**

* (b) Except as specificed in (e) of this section, the daily bag and possession limit is three male crab per person; if the regionwide harvestable biomass of mature red and blue king crab is below 200,00 pounds, the commissioner may, by emergency order, reduce the bag and possession limit of red and blue king crab.

#Proposed Harvest Strategy

##Commercial Fishery

**5 AAC 34.113 Southeast Alaska Red and Blue King Crab Management Plan**

* (a) The commissioner may, by emergency order, open the red and blue king crab fishery only if the depatment's preseason survey estimate of mature male red king crab biomass equals at least 50 percent of the 1979-2019 average survey estimate of mature male biomass.

* (b) If the commercial red and blue king crab fishery is open under (b) of this section, and the preseason survey estimate of mature males is

    + (1) at least 50 percent but less than 100 percent of the 1979-2019 average survey biomass estimate of mature males, the number of legal males available for harvest will be no more than than 0.1 x MMB x (MMB/MMB~1979-2019~), where MMB = the current year pre-season survey biomass estimate of mature males, and MMB~1979-2019~ = the 1979-2019 average survey biomass estimate of mature males, or 25 percent of the preseason survey biomass estimate of legal males, whichever is less. 
    
    + *(1)  at least 50 precent but less than 100 percent of the 1979-2019 average survey biomass estimate of mature males the number of legal males avaiable for harvest will be no more than 0.1 x (MMB/MMB~1979-2019~) x MMB(~regionwide~) where MMB = the current year pre-season survey biomass estimate of mature males, and MMB~1979-2019~ = the 1979-2019 average survey biomass estimate of mature males, or 25 percent of the preseason survey biomass estimate of legal males, whichever is less.*
    
    + (2) equal to or greater than the 1979-2019 average survey biomass estimate of mature males, the number of legal males availble for harvest will be no more than 10 percent of the preseason survey biomass estimate of mature males or 25 percent of the preseason survey estimate of legal males, whichever is less.

* (c) In implementing this harvest strategy, the department shall consider the reliability of abundance estimates of red king crab, the manageability of the fishery, and other factors the department determiens necessary to manage consistent with sustained yield principles, and shall use the best scientific information available and consider all sources of uncertainty as necessary to avoid overfishing.

* (d) For the purposes of this section,

    + (1) "preseason survey biomass estimate" means the
    
        - (A) population number of legal and mature male red king crab present in the time of the preason survey as estimated directy by the catch survey analysis method from annual pot survey data;
    + (2) "mature males" means all male red king crab at least 129 millimeters in length of shell
    + (3) "legal males" means all male red king crab at least seven inches or greater in width of shell. 

* (e) Except as provided in (f) of this section in Registration Area A, the holder of a CFEC permit or interim use permit for red and blue king crab may not retain more king crab in the directed fishery than the annual amount of king crab equal quota share that is specificed by the department. The department shall determine the annual ammount of king crab equal quota share by dividing the annual harvest objective by the number of CFEC permits and interim use permits eligible to fished in the fishery. The department shall use the best available information, including harvest rate and biological data, to set the total allowable catch.

* (f) If a permit holder's harvest exceeds the permit holder's equal quota share established under (e) of this section for that year, by not more than five percent, the department shall reduce the permit holder's equal quota share for the following year by the amount of the overage. The adjusted equal quota share is the permit holder's quota share for that year. If a permit holder's harvest exceeds the permit holder's equal quota share by more than five percent, the proceeds from the sale of the overage in excess of five percent shall be surrendered to the state. A permit holder may not assume that the ability to adjust a quota share under this section is an opprotunity to knowingly exceed a quota share or to exceed the equal quota share in an amount greater than five percent as such actions may be prosecuted under AS 16.05.722 or AS 16.05.723.

* (g) If a permit's holder's harvest is less than the permit holder's equal quota share established under (e) of this section for that year, the department shall increase the permit holders equal quota share only for the following year by the amount of the underage that does not exceed five percent of the equal quota share.

##Personal Use Fishery

**5 AAC 77.664. Personal use king crab fishery.**

  * (b) Except as specified in (e) of this section, the daily bag and possession limit is three male crab per person; if the pre-season survey estimate of mature male red king crab is less than 50% of the 1979-2019 average survey estimate of mature males, the commissioner may, by emergency order, reduce the bag and possession limit of red and blue king crab.
